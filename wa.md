reasons of WA
=============

591 - initialization of variable
10203 - output formatting
10596 - forget to check other cases (problem is wierd still)
10349 - wrong approach
101 - forgot about special case desribed in problem statement
10285 - swapped input parameters
10913 - off by one of state space
1056 - wrong approach
382 - hasty read of output format
673 - input format
543 - not sure (RE) looks like iterator arithmetics
11526 - integer overflow
11176 - wrong approach (TLE)
11101 - too optimistic bound
763 - not careful branching
11955 - number overflow
10878 - output format
343 - off by one in input
389 - java turns out to be too slow, ingnored PE in c++
10235 - hasty ready of statement
10139 - wrong solution
11728 - wrong solution (subsolution was not independed as first assumed)
